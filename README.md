Typewriter
==========

Provides the ability to enter text by simulating key presses.

When a keyboard is present, an instance of TWRTypist can be used to enter a string.

As of the current moment, the following characters are supported:
*  Uppercase letters
*  Lowercase letters
*  Spaces

This library uses private APIs, and so should not be used in production. However, despite this limitation it serves as very useful during testing.

This library is very much a work in progress, and so the API may be subject to potentially drastic change and simplification. A big thanks to the Square crew, as much of the implementation is extracted from KIF (https://github.com/square/KIF).
